# FlapplyBrain ðŸ§ 
A game like the Flapply Bird. I'm just trying to study more games with JS... I'm studying javaScript in games watching videos from Code with Ania KubÃ³w #JavaScriptGames
This is version based in Ania code. For the original: https://github.com/kubowania/flappy-bird

*I'm still making improvements in my game*
